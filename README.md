# analysis-stockmarket

*I've always been interested in the stock market.  This project is a simple hobby project that I've created as a method of backtesting my investment strategies and continuing with my python development.<br>*

I hope to explore two different strategies:
- Buy-on-Dip - where you purchase shares each time the market dips.
- Dollar-Cost-Averaging - where I you invest the same dollar value into the market on a regular basis.
